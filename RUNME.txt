HOW TO RUN
# cd to stomp_server directory

start the server
$ bin/stompserver  -f=20 -t=20

above the optional 'f' and 't' flags specify checking all queues every f seconds
for messages older than t seconds, which are removed from the queue.
Default vaules are 10 seconds for each. 

to run tests, first start the server (without t or f flags. changing
these might cause some tests to fail)
ex.
$ ruby tests/test_timeouts.rb
